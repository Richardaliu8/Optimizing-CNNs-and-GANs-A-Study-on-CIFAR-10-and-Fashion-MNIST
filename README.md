# Optimizing-CNNs-and-GANs-A-Study-on-CIFAR-10-and-Fashion-MNIST
This project optimizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST datasets. By incorporating batch normalization, we improved performance and stability. The study demonstrates significant enhancements in image classification and generation.
